### This is a data cleaning challenge i participated in. It was organized by [Promise Nonso](https://twitter.com/PromiseNonso_) and [Victor Somadina](https://twitter.com/vicSomadina)

DataCleaning challenge provides an opportunity for every Data Analyst at all levels of expertise (beginner, intermediate, or even expert) to build a portfolio-worthy project that can be shared with recruiters.

The challenge also provides an avenue for Data Analysts to meet with fellow learners and build a great network.

The Data that was analysed in this project is  a FIFA21 dataset, scraped from the fifa website.
The data is very messy and not properly arranged. The aim of the project is to cleaning and prepare the data for future modelling.
